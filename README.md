Built a complete website using Node, Express and EJS.  With the knowledge of routing, templates, modular development and project organization was examined. 
The choice of subject matter was up to me, but my site  must consist of:

- A home page and routes to at least 2 other top level pages.
- The 2 top level pages should each have at least 2 routes to sub pages
Eg: sub pages should be accessible with a url such as: mysite/page1/subpage1

That is a minimum of 7 accessible routes.
